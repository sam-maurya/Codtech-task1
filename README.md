### Project Description: Arduino LED Blink

This project demonstrates the basics of embedded programming using an Arduino board. By controlling an LED, you will learn how to interface with hardware components and create simple timing functions. The objective is to make an LED blink at a regular interval, which introduces fundamental concepts such as digital output, timing functions, and state management in microcontroller programming.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- **Digital Output:** How to control an LED by setting a digital pin to high or low states.
- **Timing Functions:** Using the `millis()` function to create non-blocking delays, allowing the Arduino to perform other tasks while waiting.
- **State Management:** Understanding how to track and toggle the state of the LED to create a blinking effect.

### Components Used:
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- LED
- Resistor (220Ω)
- Breadboard and jumper wires

### Circuit Layout:
The LED is connected to one of the Arduino’s digital output pins (pin 13), with the other end connected to ground through a resistor. This setup allows the Arduino to control the LED by changing the output state of the connected pin.

### Code Overview:
The provided Arduino code continuously checks the elapsed time and toggles the LED state at a specified interval (1000 milliseconds by default). This results in the LED blinking on and off at a steady rate, demonstrating basic microcontroller functionality.

This project is a great introduction to working with the Arduino platform, offering hands-on experience with both hardware and software aspects of embedded systems.
